# 🚀 **Auto Video Annotation System**
Manual video annotation is a slow, labor-intensive, and costly process, often leading to inconsistencies. Traditional methods struggle to scale efficiently, making it difficult to generate high-quality, large-scale annotated datasets across different domains.

## 📌 **Introduction** {#introduction}

### 💡 **Solution Overview**  
This **Auto Video Annotation System** leverages state-of-the-art AI models to automate video labeling, improving efficiency and scalability while maintaining accuracy.

### 🔥 **Key Features**  
👉 **Automated Annotation Pipeline** – Uses advanced AI model [(*Grounding DINO*)](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) to detect and label objects in videos, reducing manual effort.  

👉 **Scalable & Efficient System** – Built with a lightweight, high-performance FastAPI backend for seamless integration and large-scale data processing.  

👉 **Optimized Video Processing** – Implements frame segmentation [(*SAM*)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and propagation [(*SAMv2*)](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/samv2) to minimize redundant computation while maintaining accuracy.  

👉 **Reliable Info Monitoring** – Includes (*Supervision*) for annotation handling, and robust logging for debugging and consistency.

## 🎥 **Video Processing Features** {#video-processing-features}

🎯 **Zero-shot detection → labeling → segmentation**  

🎮 **Customizable FPS** – Users can adjust the frames per second (FPS) to optimize processing time.  

⏸️ **Interrupts for annotation refinement**:  
   🔹 **STOPPROCESS** – Users can stop the segmentation at any point and retrieve the segmented video up to that point.  
   
   🔹 **STOPDETECTION** – Users can halt new object detection while continuing segmentation of previously detected objects across the video.  
   
   🔹 **Refinement Interrupt** – Users can refine tight segmentation masks by adding positive/negative click labels for specific objects.
